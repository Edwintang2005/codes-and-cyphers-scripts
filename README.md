**Valid ISBN**
This is a program that takes in a 10 digit ISBN and verifies if it is a valid ISBN or not. In the case that it isn't, it will ask the user to determine a digit that is invalid and will try alternative digits until it can find a corrected isbn.

This is in validISBN.py.

**Modulo and Euler Function**
This is a series of programs that work on a modulo field to determine things like the euler function, inverse in the field, order etc. A full list of functionality is available when the program is run and simply follow the instructions inside the code.

This is run in moduloAndEulerFunction.py

**Fermat Factorisation**
This is code to determine the fermat factorisation of a number. This is quite straightforward and just an implementation of the mathematical algorithm.

This is in fermatFactorisation.py
